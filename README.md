## Dependencies

The MySkin app relies on the following dependencies, which are managed in the `pubspec.yaml` file:

- `splashscreen: ^1.3.5`: A package used to display a splash screen when the app starts.
- `intro_views_flutter: ^2.8.0`: Provides onboarding screens with customizable features.

Note: The `flutter_lints: ^2.0.0` package is used for linting and enforcing good coding practices.

## Usage

The MySkin app consists of several screens and features. Here's an overview of each component:

- **SplashScreen**: The initial screen that appears when the app is launched, displaying the app logo.
- **OnboardingScreen**: Guides new users through a series of informative screens about the app's features and benefits.
- **LoginScreen**: Allows existing users to log in using their credentials.
- **SignUpScreen**: Enables new users to create an account and register with the app.
- **HomeScreen**: Serves as the main screen after successful login, providing access to various app features.
- **ProfileScreen**: Displays the user's profile information and allows for editing.
- **SkinTypeQuizScreen**: Presents a series of questions to determine the user's skin type.
- **RoutineSetupScreen**: Helps users set up personalized skincare routines based on their skin type.
- **ProductRecommendationsScreen**: Shows product recommendations tailored to the user's skin type.

To navigate between screens, the app uses named routes. The `routes` property in the `MyApp` class defines the mapping of route names to screen widgets.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to customize the app according to your needs.
